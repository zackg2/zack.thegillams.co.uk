    <h1>School in the 1960s</h1>

    <p>To lern about the 1960s I asked my grandad what it was like in school in the 1960s.</p>

    <h2>bad behaviour</h2>

    <blockquote>
        "The headmaster had a cane, he would cane people's bottoms if they were naughty [...], another teacher used to throw a chalkboard rubber at pupils if they were misbehaving in class." -- Grandad Gillam
    </blockquote>

    <p>2019 is different to the 1960s because in 2019 if you were naughty you would be told off and put on time out but in the 1960s you would get hurt.</p>

    <h2>subjects</h2>

    <blockquote>
        "Maths, english, geography, physiscs, physical education, technical drawing, art, general science, woodwork, religious knowledge, history, economics" -- Grandad Gillam
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the 1960s they lernd the same exeped PSHE.</p>

    <h2>assembly</h2>

    <blockquote>
        "In secondary school you went into assembly and you stood with [...] the whole school [...]. The teachers and the headmaster would be up at the front and we'd sing a few hymns and say a prayer and then we'd go off to lessons." -- Grandad Gillam
    </blockquote>

    <p>That is the same exeped they did not sit down and we do not do a prayer and we sing pop songs and they sing hymn songs.</p>

    <h2>Break</h2>

    <blockquote>
      "In my younger days at secondary school we actually had a 'milk break' in the morning. Half way through the morning we'd all stop and have a small bottle of milk that was given to us. But they cut that out later on because it was too expensive." -- Grandad Gillam

    </blockquote>

    <p>They drank milk but we played outside.</p>

    <h1>Other things we learned</h1>
    <p><em>This section and the quotes above were typed by Zack's Dad.</em></p>

    <h2>School trips</h2>

    <p>Grandad went on school trips like I have.</p>

    <h2>Uniform</h2>

    <p>It's the same because we both had uniform, but it's different because Grandad had a different uniform to us</p>

    <h2>Class size</h2>

    <blockquote>"We didn't have any teaching assistants, we just had one teacher" -- Grandad Gillam</blockquote>

    <p>It's different because I mostly have four teachers but Grandad <em>only</em> had one teacher.</p>

    <h2>What did you have instead of computers?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      "We didn't have calculators, computers, any electronic gizmos like that; we had pencils, paper, log books (for working out maths and stuff like that) and a slide rule which is like a ruler inside of another ruler that you can slide up and down and line things up to give you answers to questions" -- Grandad Gillam

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Writing</h2>

    <p>At school I write with pencils and green pens, but Grandad used quills and fountain pens and cartridge pens.</p>
