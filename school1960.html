    <h1>School in the 1960s</h1>

    <p>To lern about the 1960s I asked my grandad what it was like in school in the 1960s.</p>

    <h2>bad behaviour</h2>

    <blockquote>
    "The headmaster had a cane, he would cane people's bottoms if they were naughty [...], another teacher used to throw a chalkboard rubber at pupils if they were misbehaving in class" -- Grandad Gillam
    </blockquote>

    <p>2019 is different to the 1960s because in 2019 if you were naughty you would be told off and put on time out but in the 1960s you would get hurt.</p>
