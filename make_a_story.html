      <p>
        At the crack of dawn,<span class="name">name</span> was already
        <span class="verbofspeed"></span> across the Arctic ocean and they were
        exited to see their new friends. However they were still
        <span class="sadadj">sad</span>
        that they were leaving their family behind in antartica.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the tides sped up and they were
        <span class="tobebrung"></span> towards the edge of the Republic of
        South Africa . They <span class="movment">walked</span> around for a
        while and found a jungle with a
        <span class="jungle_animal">lion</span> in it.Soon after, they swam with
        exotic fish , ran up a hill and eat lunch with the
        <span class="jungle_animal">lion </span>.He said good bye to the
        <span class="jungle_animal">lion</span> and dived back in the cool
        water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, they got tiered and they were near Saudi Arabia. So they swam as
        fast as they could to the countoury so he could rest. As he aproched
        land , he saw some <span class="desert_animal">camal</span> drinking at
        the oasis and he asked one their name and they replyed "charlie".
        Afterwards, <span class="name">pat</span> road the
        <span class="desert_animal">camel</span>, had a drink of oasis water and
        poked a pricaly cactus. Then, <span class="name">pat</span>shouted bye
        to charlie and <span class="verbofspeed"></span> off into the ocean.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later on,he saw the famous Niagara Falls
        <span class="name"></span> wondered if they could swim up it so
        <span class="name"></span> tried and tried agian but he just couldn't do
        it so he looked for a friend instead. Soon, he found a friend
        <span class="jungleanimal"></span> hunted with it ,climbed trees, and
        raced the <span class="jungleanimal"></span> . Afterwards,
        <span class="name"></span> leaped off back into the water and
        <span class="verbofspeed"></span> off.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, <span class="name"></span> had arrived at
        <span class="city_by_the_ocean"></span> bay
        <span class="name"></span> climbed on and
        <span class="movment">walked</span> as fast as they could to get to
        <span class="school">newlands</span> to meet his new friends.
