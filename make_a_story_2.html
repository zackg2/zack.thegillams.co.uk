      <h1>winter cavern</h1>
      <p>
        It has been many years since <span class="old_name"></span>'s time and
        the tiny village of <span class="tiny_village"></span> has grown intoa
        huge,crowded town known as <span class="town_name"></span>. These were
        <span class="happy"></span> years, until
        <span class="worring"></span> tales of dissapering children started to
        roam <span class="town_name"></span>.People say the mysterious
        child-taker goes by the name of <span class="evil_character"></span>,
        who stelithly sneaks in just after midnight and when the sun rises the
        next morning, a child is always mising.
      </p>
      <p>
        One faitful night, <span class="evil_character"></span> crawled in
        <span class="main"></span>'s house undetected, as everyone slept.When
        <span class="main"></span> woke, earlier then usual,he imediatly noticed
        that his beloved sister, <span class="sister"></span>, had vanashed!
        Crushed,he secretly stuffed his pocket with bread and nuts and
        stealthily crept out the house. He trudged through the thick,rough snow,
        as the rushing blizard swooped at him.He went on towards what seamed
        like an endless mountian side.
      </p>
      <p>
        As <span class="main"></span> <span class="rolled"></span> through the
        furious blizard, he heard the high-pitched screached screached of a fox
        haning from the fox's mouth was a mesterious leather parcle.ontop, was a
        note saying "use this.". Filled with exitement,
        <span class="main"></span> ripped open the parcel and found a scorching
        ,curved knife and <span class="struggled"></span> up the mamouth,jaged
        mountian.
