  Once upon a time, there was an adventurous, poor woodcuter called Tori.
  She lived in a small crowded village on the edge of the amazon rainforest.
  Every other day she hiked down to the rainforest where she took her axe
  and cart from her man made shed.There she stood under an emerald leaved
  canipie, swung her axe and chopped down many trees. When her cart was
   full, she  would hike back to the rustic village. When she arrived home,
   she would sell all the wood to furnature factories.
